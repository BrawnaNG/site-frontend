## FAQ

#### What is the deal with Brawna?
The original brawna.org first started around 2006, run by Lingster. In late
2015, the site suffered a catastrophic failure, and dropped off the Internet.
In 2025 Brawna was revived by a small, dedicated team of tech folks who loved
and missed the old site.
