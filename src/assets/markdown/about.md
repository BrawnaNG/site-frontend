## FAQ

#### What is the deal with Brawna?
The original brawna.org first started around 2006, run by Lingster. In late
2015, the site suffered a catastrophic failure, and dropped off the Internet.
In 2025 Brawna was revived by a small, dedicated team of tech folks who loved
and missed the old site.

#### Who wrote all these stories?
Each story has it's own author, although many authors have writeen multiple
stories and chapters. You can see the name of the author on each story or
chapter.

#### Some of the stories have weird characters, or formatting, or the chapters aren't connected, or...
Yea, we know. We've imported the data from an old Wordpress backup, and this is what we've got. If you'd like to help clean things up, give us a shout on Discord, we'd love the help!

#### How is this site built?
The site is a Vite frontend SPA calling a Django REST backend. All of the source is available [on Github](https://github.com/BrawnaNG). And if you understood everything in this paragraph, we'd love to have you help us! We've got a long list of features we want to implement, and could use the help! Give us a shout on Discord.

#### If I put a story up here, how will I know it won't disappear again some day?
FfejL is committed to keeping everything available. To that end, the source for Brawna is available to anyone who wants it [on Github](https://github.com/BrawnaNG). . Nightly backups of the database will be made pubically available soon.

#### I have a question I don't see here
Please join our Discord and ask! Someone will be happy to help. You can also email us at brawna2023@gmail.com.
